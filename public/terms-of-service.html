            You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the authentication 
            process. You are responsible for updating your information with the third-party provider 
            if it changes.

            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire 
            agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements
